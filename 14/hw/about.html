            Animal Rescue, Relocation and Maintenance: rescue of abandoned animals from the circuses, entertainment industries, wildlife trade and animal experimentation laboratories. These animals are commonly rescued after a campaign of awareness and education by Animal Defenders International, Inc., U.S.. When governments, such as South America ban the use of animals in circuses. Animal Defenders International, Inc., U.S. assists with relocation of the animals into sanctuaries and then provides support for those sanctuaries to maintain the rescued animals by providing medical treatment, nutrition and a forever home.
