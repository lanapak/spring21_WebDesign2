        As the direct result of Richard having spent most of his founding days enthusiastically marching against the grain with regards to almost everything, Chrome Hearts is now a veritable empire, built little by little from personal friendships and respect. The label has always possessed a certain pull for famous faces from Aerosmith to Kendrick Lamar, Kate Hudson to Rihanna. “We add collections and do collaborations with our friends, who may not have done jewelry before – but I think if you have taste, then you can make anything,” Laurie Lynn says faintly, calling from somewhere in the mountains of California. Jesse Jo’s spin on the brand sees Chrome Hearts working with younger figures such as artist Matt DiGiacomo – who created an eyewear collection along with hand-painted leather jackets and shoes for the label – and current it-girl Bella Hadid.
